Thanks for choosing Emil's Soundboard System v0.11

to install:

1. Put the Provided prefab (inside the main folder) inside the root of the avatar (in the hiearchy).

2. Insert your audioclips and images in the "Audio Clip List" and "Place Holder Image" fields.

3. Click on the build button

4. Click on the Finish set-up button

5. Merge the "Emil'sSoundboardFX" to your current FX, using AV3 Manager is recomended (get from vcc). 
   You can alternatively just override the current fx layer of your avatar but this will remove any other animations that is comming from this animator (not recommended)

6. Fill in the constraints for both the root of the prefab as well as the on/off contact, you should put the head for the root constraint and your wrist for the on off constaint.

7. Enjoy! if any bugs happend plase contact me through discord ==> emil1326_7742

!! variables under Advanced settings can break a lot of things, modify at your risks

!! this package cannot be transfered to quest as that it audiosources are not allowed for quest

you are encouraged to open the Exemple scene to see a proper set-up if you arent sure of how to set it up.

the physbone root should be placed sligthly above the chest and should be going down a bit for better comfort.
